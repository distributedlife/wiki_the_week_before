The **federal districts** (, *federalnyye okruga*) are groupings of the
federal subjects of Russia. Federal districts are not provisioned by the
Constitution of Russia and are not the constituent units of the country,
but exist purely for the convenience of operation and governing by
federal government agencies. Each district includes several federal
subjects and each federal district has a presidential envoy titled a
*Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian
Federation in a Federal District*.

The federal districts and positions of Plenipotentiary Representatives
were originally created in 2000 by Presidential Decree "to ensure
implementation of the President of the Russian Federation of its
constitutional powers". Plenipotentiary Representatives are appointed by
the President and are employees of the Presidential Administration.

History
-------

President Vladimir Putin established seven federal districts in May
2000.

On January 19, 2010 the new North Caucasian Federal District split from
the Southern Federal District.

On March 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, Crimean Federal District
was established.

Functions
---------

The Plenipotentiary Representatives and their staff ascertain the extent
of a subjects' violation of federal laws and norms.

During the segmented federalism of the Yeltsin administration of
1991-1999, subject governments had "captured" Federal agencies,
particularly in the justice system.

The federal districts coincide closely with the Interior Ministry
forces' military regions and with the Defense Ministry regions.
