The **transport network of the Russian Federation** is one of the
world's most extensive. The national web of roads, railways and airways
stretches almost 4800mi from Kaliningrad in the west to the Kamchatka
Peninsula in the east, and major cities such as Moscow and Saint
Petersburg are served by extensive rapid transit systems.

Russia has adopted two national transport strategies in recent years. On
12 May 2005, the Russian Ministry of Transport adopted the Transport
Strategy of the Russian Federation to 2020. Three years later, on 22
November 2008, the Russian government adopted a revised strategy,
extending to 2030.

The export of transport services is an important component of Russia’s
GDP. The government anticipates that between 2007 and 2030, the measures
included in its 2008 transport strategy will increase the export of
transport services to a total value of \$80 billion, a sevenfold
increase on its 2008 value. Foreign cargo weight transported is expected
to increase from 28 million tonnes to 100 million tonnes over the same
period. image:RU083 09.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Postage stamp issued in

Russia has the world's second-largest railway network, second only to
that of the United States, with a total track length of 87157km as of
2011. Of this, 86200km uses a broad rail gauge of 1520mm, while a narrow
gauge of 1067mm is used on a 957-km (595-mile) stretch of railway on
Sakhalin Island. Electrified track accounts for around half of the
Russian railway network - totalling 40300km - but carries the majority
of railway traffic. Image:TGM3-045-2007-Sakhalin.jpg|thumb| Sakhalin

railway Russian Railways, the state-owned national rail carrier, is one
of the world's largest transport companies, enjoying a monopoly over
rail transport in Russia. Established in 1992, it employs an estimated
950,000 people, and accounted for 2.5% of the entire national GDP in
2009. In 2007 alone, Russian Railways carried a total of 1.3 billion
passengers and 1.3 billion tons of freight on its common-carrier routes.

-   Norway – no – But Proposed Via Finland & Sweden – break of gauge
    1524mm/1435mm, or Murmansk – Kirkenes (10 km of 1435mm on the
    Norwegian side will probably be widened to 1520mm
-   Finland – Yes — *same* gauge of 1524mm/1520mm

Roads and highways
------------------

As of 2006 Russia had 933,000 km of roads, of which 755,000 were paved.
Some of these make up the Russian federal motorway system.

Road safety in Russia is poor with road accident deaths per million
population higher than all countries in the G8 and the other BRIC
countries, although the absolute number is actually less than China,
India and USA . When assessing the level of risk when travelling on
Russia's roads (i.e. the number of accidents per unit of travel) it is
60 times that of Great Britain. With a large land area the road density
is the lowest of all the G8 and BRIC countries. Dashcams are widespread,
inasmuch as Russian courts prefer video evidence to eye witness
testimony, but also as a guard against police corruption and insurance
fraud.

Inland waterways
----------------

Total navigable routes in general use: 101,000 km;\
routes with navigation guides serving the Russian River Fleet
95,900 km;\
routes with night navigational aids 60,400 km;\

According to the data of the Maritime Board (*Morskaya Kollegiya*) of
the Russian Government for 2004, 136.6 million tons of cargo have been
carried that year over Russia's inland waterways, the total cargo
transportation volume being 87,556.5 million ton-km. During same year,
53 companies were engaged in carrying passengers over Russia's inland
waterways; they transported 22.8 million passengers, the total volume of
river passenger transportation being 841.1 million passenger-km.

Pipelines
