Image:Russia Koppen Map.png|thumb|750px|A [Köppen climate map of
Russia.](Köppen climate classification "wikilink") The **climate of
Russia** is formed under the influence of several determining factors.
The enormous size of the country and the remoteness of many areas from
the sea result in the dominance of the continental climate, which is
prevalent in European and Asian Russia except for the tundra and the
extreme southeast. Mountains in the south obstructing the flow of warm
air masses from the Indian Ocean and the plain of the west and north
makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.

Dynamics
--------

Due to the moderating influence of the Atlantic or Pacific, most areas
of the country in European Russia, in the south of West Siberia and in
the south of the Russian Far East, including the cities of Moscow and
Saint Petersburg, experience a humid continental climate. (Köppen
climate classification|Köppen's Dfb, Dfa, Dwb, Dwa types). Most of
Northern European Russia and Siberia between the Scandinavian Peninsula
and the Pacific Ocean has a subarctic climate, with extremely severe
winters (Dfd, Dwd) in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the
Sakha Republic, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the
record low temperature of −68°C), and more moderate (Dwc, Dfc)
elsewhere.

The strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean, as well as the
Arctic islands, have a polar climate (extreme polar climate (EF) on some
of the islands and tundra climate (ET) elsewhere). A small portion of
the Black Sea coast, most notably in Sochi, possesses a humid
subtropical climate (Köppen's Cfa) with unusually wet winters. Winter is
dry compared to summer in many regions of East Siberia and the Far East
(Dwa, Dwb, Dwc, Dwd types), while other parts of the country experience
more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most
parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower
Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost
Siberia, possess a semi-arid climate (BSk).

About 65% of the Russian territory is underlined by permafrost.
