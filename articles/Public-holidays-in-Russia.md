The following is the list of **official public holidays recognized by
the Government of Russia**. On these days, government offices, embassies
and some shops, are closed. If the date of observance falls on a
weekend, the following Monday will be a day off in lieu of the holiday.

Official holidays
-----------------

### New Year holiday

In addition to New Year's Day (Новый год *Novy god*) on 1 January, 2–5
January are public holidays as well, called New Year holiday (Новогодние
каникулы *Novogodniye kanikuly*). The holiday includes January 6 and 8,
with Christmas being January 7, declared as non-working days by law.
Until 2005, only 1 and 2 January were public holidays.

### Christmas day

Christmas in Russia (Рождество Христово *Rozhdestvo Khristovo*) is
observed, on 7 January, as a public holiday according to the Julian
calendar used by the Russian Orthodox Church. The public holiday was
re-established in 1991, following the decades of suppression of religion
and state atheism of the Soviet Union. Christmas on 25 December is
celebrated in Russia by the Roman Catholic and various Protestant
churches, but is not a public holiday.

### Defender of the Fatherland Day

The Defender of the Fatherland Day (День защитника Отечества *Den
zashchitnika Otechestva*) is celebrated on 23 February, and is a day of
the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The holiday was established
in 1918.

### International Women's Day

On the eve of World War I campaigning for peace, Russian women observed
their first International Women's Day on the last Sunday in February
1913. In 1913 following discussions, International Women's Day was
transferred to 8 March and this day has remained the global date for
International Women's Day ever since.

### National Flag Day

The National Flag Day is an official holiday in Russia, established in
1994. It is celebrated on 22 August, the day of the victory over
putschists in 1991, but it is not a day-off.

### Spring and Labour Day

In the former Soviet Union, 1 May was International Workers' Day and was
celebrated with huge parades in cities like Moscow. Though the
celebrations are low-key nowadays, several groups march on that day to
protest grievances the workers have.

### Victory Day

May 9, Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, while
remembering those who died in order to achieve it. On 9 May 1945 (by
Moscow time) the German military surrendered to the Soviet Union and the
Allies of World War II in Berlin (Karlshorst). A military parade is held
in Moscow to celebrate the day. Victory Day (День Победы *Den Pobedy*)
is by far one of the biggest Russian holidays. It commemorates those who
died in WWII and pays tribute to survivors and veterans. Flowers and
wreaths are laid on wartime graves and special parties and concerts are
organized for veterans. In the evening there is a firework display. A
huge military parade, hosted by the President of the Russian Federation,
is annually organized in Moscow on Red Square. Similar parades are
organized in all major Russian cities

### Russia Day

**Russia Day** (День России *Den Rossii*) is the national day,
celebrated on June 12. On this day, in 1990, Russian parliament formally
declared Russian sovereignty from the USSR (unlike all other ex-Soviet
republics) which declared complete state independence, Russian
independence was less radical, and coexistence of Russian and USSR state
power had a place until the end of 1991). The holiday was officially
established in 1992. Initially it was named **Day of the Adoption of the
Declaration of Sovereignty of the Russian Federation**, on 1 February
2002 it was officially renamed to Russia Day (in 1998 Boris Yeltsin
offered this name socially). There exists a misconception in Russian
society, that this holiday is also called Russia's Independence Day, but
it never had such a name in official documents. According to the survey
of Levada Center in May 2009, 44% of the respondents named the holiday
as Independence Day of Russia.

### Unity Day

Unity Day (День народного единства *Den narodnogo edinstva*) was first
celebrated on November 4, 2005, commemorates the popular uprising led by
Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky which ejected the Polish invaders from
Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of the Time of
Troubles and foreign intervention in Russia. The event was marked by a
public holiday which was held in Russia on October 22 (Old Style) from
1649 till 1917. Its name alludes to the idea that all the classes of
Russian society willingly united to preserve Russian statehood when its
demise seemed inevitable, even though there was neither Tsar nor
Patriarch to guide them. Most observers view this as an attempted
replacement to counter Communist demonstrations on November 7 holiday,
which marked the anniversary of the October Revolution. Recently a film
*1612* was made to explain to the Russian audiences the history behind
the new holiday. National Unity Day is also known as Consolidation Day
(as an alternative translation), which people in Russia celebrate on
November 3 - November 4.
