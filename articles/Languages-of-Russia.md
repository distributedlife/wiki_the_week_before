Of all the **languages of Russia**, Russian is the only official
language. 27 different languages are considered official languages in
various regions of Russia, along with Russian. There are over 100
minority languages spoken in Russia today.

History
-------

Russian was the sole official language of the Russian Empire which
existed until 1917. During the Soviet period, the policy toward the
languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. The
state helped develop alphabets and grammar for various languages across
the country that had previously been lacking a written form. Though each
of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying
role and superior status was reserved for Russian.

Russian lost its status in many of the new republics that arose
following the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Russia, however,
the dominating status of the Russian language continued. Today, 97% of
the public school students of Russia receive their education only or
mostly in Russian, even though Russia is made up of approximately 80%
ethnic Russians
