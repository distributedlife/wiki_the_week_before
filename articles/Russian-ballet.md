**Russian ballet** is a form of ballet characteristic of or originating
from Russia. In the early 19th century, the theaters were opened up to
anyone who could afford a ticket. There was a seating section called a
rayok, or 'paradise gallery', that consisted of simple wooden benches.
This allowed non-wealthy people access to the ballet, because tickets in
this section were inexpensive.

New York City Ballet in 1948. Today, the Kirov Ballet company (now known
