Russia is divided into several **types and levels of subdivisions**.

Federal subjects
----------------

Russia is a federation which since March 18, 2014 consists of
eighty-five federal subjects (constituent members of the Federation).
However, two of these federal subjects (the Republic of Crimea and the
federal city of Sevastopol) are internationally recognized to be a part
of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the
sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the
Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). They do,
however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.

Six types of federal subjects are distinguished—22 republics, 9 krais,
46 oblasts, 3 federal cities, 1 autonomous oblast, and 4 autonomous
okrugs.

Autonomous okrugs are the only ones that have a peculiar status of being
federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are
considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects
(with Chukotka Autonomous Okrug being the only exception).

### 2014 Crimean crisis

On March 18, 2014, as a part of the 2014 Crimean crisis events and
following the establishment of the Republic of Crimea (an independent
entity recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia
and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the
City of Sevastopol as the constituent members of the Russian Federation.
According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea will be accepted as a
federal subject with the status of a republic while the City of
Sevastopol will receive federal city status. As the Republic of Crimea
is not recognized as an independent entity by the international
community, the territory being incorporated into Russia is considered to
remain a part of Ukraine by the international law.

Administrative divisions
------------------------

Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, the
administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the
Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of August 17,
1982 "On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the
Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR". The 1993
Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the
administrative-territorial divisions as the responsibility of the
federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal
government and the federal subjects. This was interpreted by the
governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the
administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of
the federal subjects. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial
structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal
subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably
different, in general, however, the following types of high-level
administrative divisions are recognized:

-   administrative districts (raions)
-   city of federal subject significance|cities/towns and urban-type
    settlements of federal subject significance
-   closed administrative-territorial formations

Autonomous okrugs and okrugs are intermediary units of administrative
divisions, which include some of the federal subject's districts and
cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance.

-   Autonomous okrugs, while being under the jurisdiction of another
    federal subject, are still constitutionally recognized as federal
    subjects on their own right. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is an
    exception in that it is not administratively subordinated to any
    other federal subject of Russia.
-   Okrugs are usually former autonomous okrugs which lost their federal
    subject status due to mergers with other federal subjects.

Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:

-   selsoviets (rural councils)
-   towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district
    significance
-   city districts

Municipal divisions
-------------------

In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004–2005, all federal
subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local
self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The
reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified
structure of the municipal government bodies by January 1, 2005, and a
law enforcing the reform provisions went in effect on January 1, 2006.
According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called
"**municipal formations**") are as follows:

-   **Municipal district**, a group of urban and rural settlements,
    often along with the inter-settlement territories. In practice,
    municipal districts are usually formed within the boundaries of
    existing administrative districts (*raions*).
    -   **Urban settlement**, a city/town or an urban-type settlement,
        possibly together with adjacent rural and/or urban localities
    -   **Rural settlement**, one or several rural localities
-   **Urban okrug**, an urban settlement not incorporated into a
    municipal district. In practice, urban okrugs are usually formed
    within the boundaries of existing cities of federal subject
    significance.
-   **Intra-city territory of a federal city**, a part of a federal
    city's territory. In Moscow, these are called **municipal
    formations** (which correspond to districts); in
    St. Petersburg—*municipal okrugs*, *towns*, and *settlements*.

Territories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as
*inter-settlement territories*.

Other types of subdivisions
---------------------------

### Federal districts

All of the federal subjects are grouped into eight **federal
districts**, each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of
Russia. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal
subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for
overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.

### Economic regions

For economic and statistical purposes the federal subjects are grouped
into twelve **economic regions**. Economic regions and their parts
sharing common economic trends are in turn grouped into economic zones
and macrozones.
