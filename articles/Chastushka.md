**Chastúshka,**,, derives from "часто" - "frequently", or from
"части́ть" - old word, that means "to do something with high frequency"
and probably refers to high beat frequency (tempo) of chastushki.

Chastushka is a traditional type of short Russian or Ukrainian folk
humorous song with high beat frequency, that consists of one four-lined
couplet, full of humor, satire or irony. Usually many chastushki are
sung one after another. Chastushka makes use of a simple rhyming scheme
to convey humorous or ironic content. The singing and recitation of such
rhymes were an important part of peasant popular culture both before and
after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

Form
----

A chastushka (plural: chastushki) is a simple rhyming poem which would
be characterized derisively in English as doggerel. The name originates
from the Russian word "часто" ("chasto") - "frequently", or from
*части́ть* ("chastit"), meaning  "to do something with high frequency"
and probably refers to high beat frequency of chastushkas.

The basic form is a simple four-line verse making use of an *ABAB*,
*ABCB,* or *AABB* rhyme scheme.

Usually humorous, satirical, or ironic in nature, chastushki are often
put to music as well, usually with balalaika or accordion accompaniment.
The rigid, short structure (and, to a lesser degree, the type of humor
used) parallels the poetic genre of limericks in British culture.

Sometimes several chastushki are delivered in sequence to form a song.
After each chastuska, there is a full musical refrain without lyrics to
give the listeners a chance to laugh without missing the next one.
Originally chastushki were a form of folk entertainment, not intended to
be performed on stage. Often they are sung in turns by a group of
people. Sometimes they are used as a medium for a back-and-forth mocking
contest. Improvisation is highly valued during chastuska singing.

Content
-------

Chastushki cover a very wide spectrum of topics, from lewd jokes to
political satire, including such diverse themes as love songs and
Communist propaganda.

Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, chastushki varied considerably in
content from region to region. In some areas hit particularly hard by
the grain requisitioning of the Soviet regime during the Civil War, such
as Riazan, peasant chastushki tended to be bitterly hostile. In other
places, particularly those in close proximity to Moscow, "Soviet
chastushki" favorable to the Bolshevik government were sung and recited.

In the early 1920s chastushki were used by Young Communists in organized
village gatherings as a form of anti-religious propaganda, subjecting
the church and the rural clergy to ridicule using the traditional rural
poetic form. Scholar Lynne Viola provides one such example of an
anti-religious Soviet rhyme, rendered here in literal English
translation:

> *All the pious are on a spree,\
> *They see god is not at home.\
> *He got drunk on homebrewed liquor,\
> *And left to go abroad.''

Given the difficult economic circumstances of the Soviet peasantry in
the late 1920s and 1930s, chastushki overwhelmingly took an
anti-government form, with the singing of anti-Soviet couplets a common
practice at peasant festivals of the period. Following the assassination
of Communist Party leader Sergei Kirov late in 1934, chastushki sprung
up relating the killing to a recent decision to terminate bread
rationing, including this literal translation of one example provided by
scholar Sheila Fitzpatrick:

> *When Kirov was killed,\
> *They allowed free trade in bread.\
> *When Stalin is killed,\
> *They will disband all the collective farms.''

Examples
--------

Many folk chastushki are lewd or laden with vulgarities. The following
are some relatively printable examples, with slightly loose English
translations that attempt to give an approximate feeling of the
chastushka's rhyme and meter, and the general meaning:

-   Bolshevik political and anti-religious propaganda:

:   Знаем Ленина заветы.
:   Кулаки, попы - наш враг
:   Призовет их всех к ответу
:   Большевицкий красный флаг.

:   
    :   We know Lenin's testaments
    :   The Kulaks, popes - our foe
    :   Calls them all to answer
    :   Bolshevik's red flag.

:   Как у тёщи под окошком
:   Я играю на гармошке.
:   Ты послушай, тёща–блядь,
:   Как наяривает зять!
    :   Mum–in–law, enjoy the fun —
    :   I am playing my bayan!
    :   Listen, you old fucking crock
    :   How your son–in–law can rock!

:   Лейтенант, лейтенант —
:   Лаковы сапожки,
:   Если девки не дают —
:   Попроси у кошки!
    :   In this boots you look so pretty,
    :   Mister Second Lieutenant
    :   In the case of girl's refusing
    :   Try to fuck an elephant!
