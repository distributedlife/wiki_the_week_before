The informal term "**Soviet Empire**" is used by critics of the Soviet
Union to refer to that country's perceived imperialist foreign policy
during the Cold War. The nations said to be part of the "Soviet Empire"
were independent countries with separate governments that set their own
policies, but those policies had to remain within certain limits decided
by the Soviet Union. Failure to stay within the limits could result in
military intervention by the Warsaw Pact. Countries in this situation
are often called satellite states. This arrangement was always
unofficial.

Though the Soviet Union was not ruled by an emperor and declared itself
anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to
historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid
entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and
nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced
colonialism as did other imperial powers, Maoists argued that the Soviet
Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a
socialist façade (social imperialism).

The other dimension of "Soviet imperialism" is cultural imperialism. The
policy of Soviet cultural imperialism implied the Sovietization of
culture and education at the expense of local traditions.

The Soviet Empire is considered to have included the following:

### The Soviet Union and its satellite states

These countries were the closest allies of the Soviet Union. They were
members of the Comecon, a Soviet-led economic community founded in 1949.
In addition, the ones located in Eastern Europe were also members of the
Warsaw Pact. They were sometimes called the *Eastern bloc* in English
and were widely viewed as Soviet satellite states.

-   Bulgaria
-   -   Czechoslovakia
-   -   Hungary
-   Mongolia
-   Poland
-   Romania
-   North Vietnam/Vietnam (1950-1976/1976-1991)
-   Albania (ended participation in Comecon after 1961 due to
    Sino-Soviet Split)

`was a Soviet ally, but always followed a highly isolationist foreign policy and therefore it did not join the Comecon or any other international organization of communist states.`

### Soviet involvement in the Third World

Some countries in the Third World had pro-Soviet governments during the
Cold War. In the political terminology of the Soviet Union, these were
"countries moving along the socialist road of development", as opposed
to the more advanced "countries of developed socialism", which were
mostly located in Eastern Europe, but also included Vietnam and Cuba.
Most received some aid, either military or economic, from the Soviet
Union, and were influenced by it to varying degrees. Sometimes, their
support for the Soviet Union eventually stopped, for various reasons; in
some cases the pro-Soviet government lost power, in other cases the
pro-Soviet forces were overthrown by military coups promoted by the
United States (such as in Chile and Brazil), in some cases the
pro-Soviet forces gained power by military aid from the Soviet Union
(such as in Vietnam), while in other cases the same government remained
in power but ended its alliance with the Soviet Union.

Some of these countries were *not* communist states. They are marked in
*italic*.

### Communist states opposed to the Soviet Union

Some communist states were openly opposed to the Soviet Union and many
of its policies. Though their forms of government may have been similar,
they were completely sovereign from the USSR and held only formal ties.
Relations were often tense, sometimes even to the point of armed
conflict.
