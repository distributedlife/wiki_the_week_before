The **Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic**, commonly
referred to as **Soviet Russia**, the **Russian Federation**, or simply
**Russia**, was a sovereign state (in 1917–22 and 1990–91) and the
largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic of the
Soviet Union. The Republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics, five
autonomous oblasts, ten autonomous okrugs, six krais, and forty oblasts.
Russians formed the largest ethnic group.

The RSFSR was established on November 7, 1917 (October Revolution) as a
sovereign state. The first Constitution was adopted in 1918. In 1922
Russian SFSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR.

The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized, accounting for
about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR. It was the
third largest producer of petroleum, trailing only the United States and
Saudi Arabia. In 1974, there were 475 institutes of higher education in
the republic providing education in 47 languages to some 23,941,000
students. A network of territorially-organized public-health services
provided health care. After 1985, the restructuring policies of the
Gorbachev administration relatively liberalised the economy, which had
gone stagnant since the late 1970s, with the introduction of non-state
owned enterprises such as cooperatives. The effects of market policies
led to the failure of many enterprises and total instability by 1990.

On June 12, 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies adopted the
Declaration of State Sovereignty. On June 12, 1991, Boris Yeltsin was
elected the first President. On December 8, 1991, heads of Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared
dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (i.e. denunciation of 1922
Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the CIS. On December
12, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament, therefore
Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de
facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR.

On December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian
Federation (Russia). On December 26, 1991, the USSR was self-dissolved
by the Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet
Union, which by that time was the only functioning house of Soviet
parliament (the other house, Soviet of the Union, had already lost the
quorum after recall of its members by the union republics). After
dissolution of the USSR, Russia declared that it assumed the rights and
obligations of the dissolved central Soviet government, including UN
membership.

The new Russian constitution, adopted on December 12, 1993 after a
constitutional crisis, abolished the Soviet system of government in its
entirety.

Nomenclature
------------

Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks established the
Soviet state on, immediately after the Russian Provisional Government,
which governed the Russian Republic, was overthrown during the October
Revolution. Initially, the state did not have an official name and
wasn't recognized by neighboring countries for five months. Meanwhile,
anti-Bolsheviks coined the mocking label "Sovdepia" for the nascent
state of the "Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies".

On January 25, 1918 the third meeting of the All-Russian Congress of
Soviets renamed the unrecognized state the **Soviet Russian Republic**.
The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918, giving away
much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany in exchange for
peace during the rest of World War I. On July 10, 1918, the Russian
Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the **Russian Socialist
Federative Soviet Republic**. By 1918, during the Russian Civil War,
several states within the former Russian Empire seceded, reducing the
size of the country even more.

Internationally, in 1920, the RSFSR was recognized as an independent
state only by Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania in the Treaty of
Tartu and by the Irish Republic.

On December 30, 1922, with the creation of the Soviet Union, Russia
became one of six republics within the federation of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. The final Soviet name for the republic, the
**Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic**, was adopted in the
Soviet Constitution of 1936 — by that time, Soviet Russia gained roughly
the same borders of the old Tsardom of Russia before the Great Northern
War of 1700.

For most of the Soviet Union's existence, foreigners sometimes used
"Russia" for the name, even though technically "Russia" was only one
republic within the larger union - albeit by far the largest, most
powerful and most highly developed.

On December 25, 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
republic was renamed the **Russian Federation**, which it remains to
this day. This name and "Russia" were specified as the official state
names in the April 21, 1992 amendment to the existing constitution and
were retained as such in the 1993 Constitution of Russia.

Geography
---------

The international borders of the RSFSR touched Poland on the west;
Norway and Finland on the northwest; and to its southeast were the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolian People's Republic, and
the People's Republic of China. Within the Soviet Union, the RSFSR
bordered the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian
SSRs to its west and Azerbaijan, Georgian and Kazakh SSRs to the south.

Roughly 70% of the area in the RSFSR consisted of broad plains, with
mountainous regions mainly concentrated in the east. The area is rich in
mineral resources, including petroleum, natural gas, and iron ore.

History
-------

### Early years (1917–20)

The Soviet regime first came to power on November 7, 1917, immediately
after the Russian Provisional Government, which governed the Russian
Republic, was overthrown in the October Revolution. The state it
governed, which did not have an official name, would be unrecognized by
neighboring countries for another five months.

On January 25, 1918, at the third meeting of the All-Russian Congress of
Soviets, the unrecognized state was renamed the **Soviet Russian
Republic**. On March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed,
giving away much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany, in
exchange for peace in World War I. On July 10, 1918, the Russian
Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the **Russian Socialist
Federative Soviet Republic**. By 1918, during the Russian Civil War,
several states within the former Russian Empire seceded, reducing the
size of the country even more.

The RSFSR was recognized as an independent state internationally by only
Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania, in the Treaty of Tartu in 1920.

### 1920s

On December 30, 1922, the First Congress of the Soviets of the USSR
approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, by which Russia was
united with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Byelorussian Soviet
Socialist Republic, and Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic
into a single federal state, the Soviet Union. Later treaty was included
in the 1924 Soviet Constitution, adopted on January 31, 1924 by the
Second Congress of Soviets of the USSR.

Paragraph 3 of Chapter 1 of the 1925 Constitution of the RSFSR states
the following:

> By the will of the peoples of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet
> Republic, who decided on the formation of the Union of Soviet
> Socialist Republics during the Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets,
> the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, being a part of the
> Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, devolves to the Union the powers
> which according to Article 1 of the Constitution of the Union of
> Soviet Socialist Republics are included within the scope of
> responsibilities of the government bodies of the Union of Soviet
> Socialist Republics.

### 1930s

Many regions in Russia were affected by the Soviet famine of 1932–1933:
Volga; Central Black Soil Region; North Caucasus; the Urals; the Crimea;
part of Western Siberia; and the Kazak ASSR.

With the adoption of the 1936 Soviet Constitution on December 5, 1936,
the size of the RSFSR was significantly reduced. The Kazakh ASSR and
Kirghiz ASSR were transformed into the Kazakh and Kirghiz Soviet
Socialist Republics. The Karakalpak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic
was transferred to the Uzbek SSR.

The final name for the republic during the Soviet era was adopted by the
Russian Constitution of 1937, which renamed it the **Russian Soviet
Federative Socialist Republic**.

### 1940s

On October 11, 1944, the Tuvan People's Republic joined the Russian SFSR
as the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast, in 1961 becoming an Autonomous Soviet
Socialist Republic.

At the end of World War II Soviet troops occupied southern Sakhalin
Island and the Kuril Islands, making them part of the RSFSR. The status
of the southernmost Kurils remains in dispute with Japan.

On April 17, 1946, the Kaliningrad Oblast—the northern portion of the
former German province of East Prussia—was annexed by the Soviet Union
and made part of the Russian SFSR.

### 1950s

Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the
Ukrainian SSR in 1954.

The Karelo-Finnish SSR was transferred back to the RSFSR as the Karelian
ASSR in 1956.

### 1960s–1980s

### Early 1990s

On May 29, 1990, at his third attempt, Boris Yeltsin was elected the
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR.

On June 12, 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Republic
adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian SFSR, which
was the beginning of the "War of Laws", pitting the Soviet Union against
the Russian Federation and other constituent republics.

On March 17, 1991, an all-Russian referendum created the post of
President of the RSFSR. On June 12, Boris Yeltsin was elected President
of Russia by popular vote.

During an 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt on
August 19–21, 1991 in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union and
Russia, President of Russia Yeltsin strongly supported the President of
the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.

On August 23, after the failure of GKChP, in the presence of Gorbachev,
Yeltsin signed a decree suspending all activity by the Communist Party
of the Russian SFSR in the territory of Russia. On November 6, he went
further, banning the Communist Parties of the USSR and the RSFSR from
the territory of the RSFSR.

On December 8, 1991, at Viskuli near Brest (Belarus), the President of
the Russian SFSR and the heads of Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR
signed the "Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of
Independent States" (known in media as Belavezha Accords). The document,
consisting of a preamble and fourteen articles, stated that the Soviet
Union ceased to exist as a subject of international law and geopolitical
reality. However, based on the historical community of peoples,
relations between them, given the bilateral treaties, the desire for a
democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based
on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties
agreed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On
December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the
Russian SFSR by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against, 7
abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR
denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and recalled all
Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The
legality of this act is the subject of discussions because, according to
the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian SFSR, the Russian
Supreme Soviet had no right to do so. However, by this time the Soviet
government had been rendered more or less impotent, and was in no
position to object.

On December 24, Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General of the United
Nations that the Russian Federation would assume the membership of the
Soviet Union in all UN organs (including membership in the UN Security
Council). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member of the UN
(since October 24, 1945) along with Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR) and Belarus
(Byelorussian SSR).

On December 25, the Russian SFSR was renamed the **Russian Federation
(Russia)**, and remains so to this day. The change was originally
published on January 6, 1992 (*Rossiyskaya Gazeta*). According to law,
during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for
official business (forms, seals and stamps).

The Russian Federation's Constitution (Fundamental Law) of 1978, though
with the 1991–1992 Amendements, remained in effect until the 1993
Russian constitutional crisis.

The name "Russian Federation" has been also used in Soviet times.

Government
----------

The Government was known officially as the Council of People's
Commissars (1917–1946), Council of Ministers (1946–1978) and Council of
Ministers–Government (1978–1991). The first government was headed by
Vladimir Lenin as "Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the
Russian SFSR" and the last by Boris Yeltsin as both head of government
and head of state under the title "President".

The Russian SFSR was controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, until the abortive 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 August
coup, which prompted President Yeltsin to suspend the recently created
Communist Party of the Russian SFSR.

Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs) within the Russian SFSR
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Turkestan ASSR – Formed on April 30, 1918, on the territory of the
    former Turkestan General-Governorate. As part of the delimitation
    programme of Soviet Central Asia, the Turkestan ASSR along with the
    Khorezm SSR and the Bukharan PSR were disbanded on October 27, 1924,
    and in their place came the Union republics of Turkmen SSR and Uzbek
    SSR. The latter contained the Tajik ASSR until December 1929 when it
    too became a full Union republic, the Tajik SSR. The RSFSR retained
    the newly formed Kara-Kirghiz and the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous
    Oblasts. The latter was part of the Kirgiz, then the Kazak ASSR
    until 1930, when it was directly subordinated to Moscow.
-   Bashkir ASSR – Formed on March 23, 1919 from several northern
    districts of the Orenburg Guberniya populated by Bashkirs. On
    October 11, 1990, it declared its sovereignty, as the Bashkir SSR,
    which was renamed in 1992 the Republic of Bashkortostan.
-   Tatar ASSR – Formed on May 27, 1920 on the territory of the western
    two thirds of the Kazan Governorate populated by Tatars. On
    October 30, 1990, declared sovereignty as the Republic of Tatarstan
    and on October 18, 1991 it declared its independence. The Russian
    constitutional court overturned the declaration on March 13, 1992.
    In February 1994, a separate agreement was reached with Moscow on
    the status of Tatarstan as an associate state in Russia with
    confederate status.
-   Kirgiz ASSR Formed on August 26, 1920, from the Ural, Turgay,
    Semipalatinsk Oblasts, and parts of Transcaspia, Bukey Horde and
    Orenburg Guberniya populated by Kirgiz-Kaysaks (former name of
    Kazakh people). Further enlarged in 1921 upon gaining land from Omsk
    Guberniya and again in 1924 from parts of Jetysui Guberniya and Syr
    Darya and Samarkand Oblasts. On 19 April 1925 renamed as the *Kazak
    ASSR* (see below)
-   Mountain ASSR Formed on January 20, 1921, after the Bolshevik Red
    Army evicted the short-lived Mountainous Republic of the Northern
    Caucasus. Initially composed of several national districts;
    one-by-one these left the republic until November 7, 1924, when the
    remains of the republic was partitioned into the Ingush Autonomous
    Oblast, the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast and the Sunzha Cossack
    district (all subordinates to the North Caucasus Kray).
-   Dagestan ASSR – Formed on January 20, 1921, from the former Dagestan

-   Crimean ASSR Formed on October 18, 1921, on the territory of Crimean
    peninsula, following the Red Army's eviction of Baron Wrangel's
    army, ending the Russian Civil War in Europe. On May 18, 1944, it
    was reduced to the status of Oblast, alongside the deportation of
    the Crimean Tatars, as collective punishment for alleged
    collaboration with the Nazi occupation regime. On February 19, 1954,
    it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR. Re-established on
    February 12 1991, it declared sovereignty on September 4 of that
    year. On May 5 1992, it declared independence as the *Republic of
    Crimea*, on May 13; the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine overturned the
    declaration, but compromised on an Autonomous Republic of Crimea. In
    March 2014, a referendum offered Crimeans the choice of remaining
    with Ukraine or rejoining Russia (but interestingly not the option
    of complete independence), reportedly resulting in over 90% of
    voters deciding in favour of joining the Russian Federation.
-   Yakut ASSR – Formed on February 16 1922 upon the elevation of the
    Yakut Autonomous Oblast into an ASSR. On September 27, 1990, it

    that of an ASSR and re-subordinated to RSFSR. It declared
    sovereignty on October 13 1991 as the Republic of Karelia.
-   Volga German ASSR – Formed on December 19, 1924, upon elevation of

    Okrug was temporarily administered by Stavropol Kray until the 22
    March, when the territory was portioned between North Ossetian and
    Dagestan ASSRs, and the Georgian SSR. The remaining land was merged
    with Stavropol Krays Kizlyar district and organised as Grozny

    re-established, though only the southern border's original shape was
    retained. Declared sovereignty on 27 November 1990 as the

    on 6 September, began a coup which overthrew the Soviet local
    government. De facto, all authority passed to the self-proclaimed
    government which was renamed as the *Chechen Republic of Ichkeria*
    in early 1993. In response, the western Ingush districts after a
    referendum on 28 November 1991, were organised into an *Ingush
    Republic* which was officially established on 4 June 1992, by decree
    of Russian President as the Republic of Ingushetia. The same decree
    de jure created a *Chechen republic*, although it would be
    established only on 3 June 1994 and carry out partial governance
