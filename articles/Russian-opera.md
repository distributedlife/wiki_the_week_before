**Russian opera** (Russian language|Russian: **Ру́сская о́пера**) is the
art of opera in Russia. Operas by composers of Russian origin, written
or staged outside of Russia, also belong to this category, as well as
the operas of foreign composers written or intended for the Russian
scene. These are not only Russian-language operas. There are examples of
Russian operas written in French, English, Italian, Latin, Ancient
Greek, Japanese, or the multitude of languages of the nationalities that
were part of the Empire and the Soviet Union.

Russian opera reached its peak in the work of such composers as Glinka,
Mussorgsky, Borodin, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky, Prokofiev
and Shostakovich.

Searching for its typical and characteristic features, Russian opera
(and Russian music as a whole), has often been under strong foreign
influence. Italian, French, and German operas have served as examples,
even when composers sought to introduce special, national elements into
their work. This dualism, to a greater or lesser degree, has persisted
throughout the whole history of Russian opera.

Opera came to Russia in the 18th century. At first there were Italian
language operas presented by Italian opera wiktionary:troupe|troupes.
Later some foreign composers serving to the Russian Imperial Court began
to write Russian-language operas, while some Russian composers were
involved into writing of the operas in Italian and French. And only at
the beginning of 1770s the first modest attempts of the composers of
Russian origin to compose operas to the Russian librettos were made.
This was not a real creation of Russian national opera per se, but
rather a weak imitation of Italian, French or German examples. But
nevertheless, these experiments were important, and paved the way for
the great achievements of 19th and 20th centuries.

### Italians

Originating in Italy in c1600, opera spread all over Europe and reached
Russia in 1731, when the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony August II
the Strong (based in Dresden) 'loaned' his Italian opera troupe to the
Russian Empress Anna for the celebration of her coronation in Moscow.

The first opera shown in Russia was ***Calandro*** by **Giovanni Alberto
Ristori** (1692–1753). It was given in Moscow in 1731 under his and his
father Tommaso Ristori’s direction, with 13 actors and nine singers
including Ludovica Seyfried, Margherita Ermini and Rosalia Fantasia.

After that Italian opera troupes were welcomed to Russia for the
entertaining of the Empress and her Court.In 1735 a big Italian opera
troupe led by a composer **Francesco Araja** was invited for the first
time to work in Saint Petersburg. The first opera given by them was
Araja’s *La forza dell'amore e dell'odio*, with a text by Francesco
Prata, staged on February 8 [OS January 29], 1736 as *Sila lyubvi i
nenavisti* (*The Power of Love and Hatred*). Araja’s next two
productions were the operas seria *SIl finto Nino, overo La Semiramide
riconosciuta* to the text by Francesco Silvani given on February 9, 1737
[OS January 28], Saint Petersburg and *Artaserse* to the text by Pietro
Metastasio, performed on February 9, 1738 [OS January 28] in Saint
Petersburg. Araja spent around 25 year in Russia and wrote at least 14
operas for the Russian Court.

In 1742, in connection witho the celebration of the coronation of
Empress Elizaveta Petrovna in Moscow the opera *Tito Vespasiano* [*La
clemenza di Tito*] by **Johann Adolf Hasse** (1699–1783) was staged. A
new theatre was built especially for this event. In 1743 at "Zimnij
Dvorets", the (Winter Palace) in Saint Petersburg, instead of a small
hall of "Comedie et opere" was built a new Opera House (architect
Bartolomeo Rastrelli) that held about a thousand persons.

The next opera seria by Araja *Seleuco*, text by Giuseppe Bonecchi was
given on May 7 [OS April 26] 1744 in Moscow as part of a double
celebration of the anniversary of the coronation of Elizaveta Petrovna
and conclusion of peace with Sweden.

The staging of Araja’s opera seria *Bellerofonte*, text by Giuseppe
Bonecchi (December 9, 1750 [OS November 28], Saint Petersburg) was
notable for the participation of a Russian singer from “pevchie” of the
Court Capella, Mark Poltoratski, who played the role of Ataman, a
nobleman of Kingdom of Likia.

The first opera written in Russian was Araja’s ***Tsefal i Prokris***
(*Cephalus and Prokris*, libretto by Alexander Sumarokov) that was
staged at Saint Petersburg on March 7, [OS February 27], 1755.

The second opera set to a Russian text was *Alceste*, 1758, libretto by
Alexander Sumarokov) by German composer **Hermann Raupach** (1728–1778)
also serving to the Russian Court. Raupach spent 18 years in Russia and
died in Saint Petersburg in 1778.

In 1757 a private opera enterprise directed by Giovanni Battista
Locatelli (1713 – c. 1770) was invited to Saint Petersburg. They had
show an opera every week for the court, and two-three times a week they
were allowed to give open public performances. The repertoire was mostly
of Italian opera buffa. For the first three years the troupe had
presented the seven operas by **Baldassare Galuppi**
(1706–1785)including *Il mondo della luna* (*The World of the Moon*),
*Il Filosofo di campagna* (*The Village Philosopher*), and *Il mondo
alla roversa, ossia Le donne che commandono* (*The Worlds Upside Down,
or Women Command*).

In the 1760–80s in Russia there were working in turn Venetian Galuppi,
Manfredini from Pistoia, Traetta from Bitonto near Barri, Paisiello from
Taranto, Sarti, Cimarosa from Campania, and Spaniard Vicente Martín y
Soler|Martin y Soler. Each of them brought an important contribution,
producing operas to the Italian as well as Russian libretti. Here are
listed some of the operas written and premiered in Russia:

**Vincenzo Manfredini** (1737–1799) spent 12 years in Russia and died in
Saint Petersburg. The son and pupil of famous baroque composer Francesco
Manfredini, he was a music teacher for Pavel Petrovich who later became
Emperor of Russia. For the Russian Imperial Court Manfredini wrote five
operas including: *Semiramide* (1760, Saint Petersburg), *L'Olimpiade*
(1762 Moscow) and *Carlo Magn*o (1763 Saint Petersburg).

**Tommaso Traetta** (1727–1779) was a *maestro di cappella* at the
Russian Imperial Court for eight years (1768–1775, and wrote there five
operas, including: *Astrea placata* (1770 Saint Petersburg), *Antigone*
(1772 Saint Petersburg), and *Le quattro stagioni e i dodici mesi
dell'anno* (1776 St Petersburg).

**Giovanni Paisiello** (1740–1816), a famous Neapolitan composer of more
than 100 operas seria and buffa, he spent in Russia eight years
(1776–1783), where he wrote 12 operas including *Nitteti* (1777 Saint
Petersburg), *Lucinda e Armidoro* (1777 Saint Petersburg), *Il barbiere
di Siviglia, ovvero La precauzione inutile* (1782 Hermitage Theatre),
and *Il mondo della luna* (1782 Kamenny Island Theatre).

**Giuseppe Sarti** (1729–1802), a composer of about 40 operas, he spent
in Russia eighteen years (1784–1802). After being for eight years a
*maestro di cappella* at the Imperial Court, he spent the next four
years at the service of Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin at his
estate in Southern Russia. Then he returned to the Court. In 1901 he
solicited permission to return, because his health was broken. The
emperor Alexander I dismissed him in 1802 with a liberal pension. Sarti
died in Berlin. His most successful operas in Russia were *Armida e
Rinaldo* and *The Early Reign of Oleg* (Nachal'noye upravleniye Olega),
for the latter of which the empress herself wrote the libretto. Among
the nine operas written in Russia are also: *Gli amanti consolati* (1784
Saint Petersburg), *I finti eredi* (1785 Saint Petersburg, Bolshoi
Kamenny Theatre), *Castore e Polluce* (1786 Hermitage Theatre) and *La
famille indienne en Angleterre* (1799 Saint Petersburg, Bolshoi Kamenny
Theatre).

**Domenico Cimarosa**, (1749–1801) another famous Neapolitan composer,
singer, violinist, harpsichordist, conductor ant teacher, who composed
about 75 operas, was a *maestro di cappella* in Russia for five years
(1787–1791), where wrote: *La felicità inaspettata* (1788 Hermitage
Theatre), ''La vergine del sol'e (1788? Hermitage Theatre; 1789 Saint
Petersburg, Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre) and *La Cleopatra* (*Cleopatra e
Marc Antonio* 1789 Hermitage Theatre)

**Vicente Martín y Soler** (1754–1806) a Spanish organist and composer
of 21 operas and 5 ballets, he settled in Russia c1788, where he was
called "Martini". He wrote there: *Gore-Bogatyr Kosometovich* (libretto
by Catherine II of Russia, 1789 Hermitage Theatre) with overture on
three Russian tunes, *Pesnolyubie* (1790 Hermitage Theatre), and *La
festa del villagio* (1798 Hermitage Theatre).

Two of his operas premiered in Vienna, but also staged in Russia, *Una
cosa rara, o sia Bellezza ed onestà* (*The Rare Thing*) and *L'arbore di
Diana* (*Diana's Tree*) were especially popular. The first of them
performed in Russian translation of Ivan Dmitrievsky had some elements
of the antifeudal directivity. He died in Saint Petersburg in January
1806.

**Ivan Kerzelli** (also known as I. I. Kerzelli, or Iosif Kertsel) was a
representative of a big family of foreign musicians Kerzelli (probably
of Czech origin), settled in Russia in 18th century. He is regarded as a
composer of a few famous operas: *Lyubovnik - koldun* (*The
Lover-Magician* 1772 Moscow), *Rozana i Lyubim* (*Rozana und Lyubim*
1778, Moscow), *Derevenskiy vorozheya* (*The Village Wizard* c. 1777

first opera fragments printed in Russia) and *Guljanye ili sadovnik
kuskovskoy* (*Promenade or the Gardener from Kuskovo* 1780 or 1781
Kuskovo, Private Theatre of Count Nikolai Sheremetev).

**Antoine Bullant** (also known as Antoine or Jean Bullant, 1750–1821),
another composer of Czech origin settled in Russia in 1780 wrote a large
number of operas with Russian librettos, often within Russian national
settings. He was especially famous for his comic opera *Sbitenshchik*
(*Сбитеньщик — Sbiten Vendor*), comic opera in 3 acts, written to the
libretto by Yakov Knyazhnin (remake of Molière's *L'école des femmes*).
The opera was staged 1783 or 1784 in Saint Petersburg, at the Bolshoi
Kamenny Theatre, and was played until 1853.

There were also extremely popular the operas by Belgian/French **André
Ernest Modeste Grétry** (1741–1813), like *L'Amitié à l'épreuve* (first
staged 1779, Kuskovo theatre) or *Les Mariages samnites* that was
performed during 12 years (since 1885, Kuskovo, Ostankino theatres) with

Two talented young Russians Berezovsky and Bortniansky were sent by
Catherine II to Italy to study art of music composition.

**Maksym Berezovsky** (1745–1777) went to Italy in the spring of 1769 to
train with Padre Giovanni Battista Martini at the Bologna Philharmonic
Academy, where he graduated with distinction. He wrote an opera seria
***Demofoonte*** to the Italian libretto by Pietro Metastasio for the
carnival at Livorno (staged February 1773).

**Dmytro Bortniansky** (1751–1825), a pupil of Hermann Raupach and
Baldassare Galuppi, went to Italy following his teacher Galuppi. In
Italy, Bortniansky gained considerable success composing operas:
*Creonte* (1776) and *Alcide* (1778) in Venice, and *Quinto Fabio*
(1779) at Modena. Bortniansky returned to the court at Saint Petersburg
in 1779 where composed four more operas (all in French, with libretti by
Franz-Hermann Lafermière): *Le Faucon* (1786), *Le Fete du Seigneur*
(1786), *Don Carlos* (1786), and *Le Fils-Rival ou La Moderne
Stratonice* (1787).

At the same time in Russia, a successful one-act opera ***Anyuta***
(Chinese Theatre, September 6 [OS August 26] 1772) was created to the
text by Mikhail Vasilyevich Popov. Music was a selection of popular
songs specified in the libretto. It is a story about a girl called
Anyuta, brought up in a peasants’ household, who in fact turned out to
be of noble birth, and the story of her love for a nobleman, Victor,
eventually ending happily, with wedding bells ringing. The score doesn’t
survived and the composer of it is unknown, however, sometimes it was
attributed to Vasily Pashkevich or even to Yevstigney Fomin who that
time was just 11 year old.

The music of another successful Russian opera *Melnik – koldun,
obmanshchik i svat* (*The Miller who was a Wizard, a Cheat and a
Match-maker*, text by Alexander Ablesimov, Moscow, 1779), on a subject
resembling Rousseau’s *Le Devin du village*, is attributed to a theatre
violin player and conductor **Mikhail Sokolovsky** (c. 1756–?). Later
the music was revised by Yevstigney Fomin.

**Vasily Pashkevich** (1742–1797), a Russian composer was famous for his
comic opera *The Miser*. Its roles are: Scriagin, Liubima’s guardian;
Liubima, his niece; Milovid, her beloved; Marfa, the servant girl that
Scriagin is in love with; Prolaz, Milovid’s manservant who is in
Scriagin’s service. Accordingly the speech and the names of the
characters of Molière's comedy were turned into Russian as well as the
music that combines some features of European form with typically
Russian melodies. Another his opera ***Fevey*** was written to the
libretto by Catherine II. Other operas are: *The Carriage Accident*
(*Neschastye ot karety*, 1779 Saint Petersburg, Karl Kniper Theatre, *St
Petersburg Bazaar* (*Sankt Peterburgskiy Gostinyi Dvor*, 1782 Saint
Petersburg), Kniper Theatre, *The Burden Is Not Heavy if It Is Yours*
(*Svoya nosha ne tyanet*, 1794), *The Early Reign of Oleg* (*Nachal'noye
upravleniye Olega*, libretto by Catherine II, 1790 Saint Petersburg)–
together with Giuseppe Sarti and C. Cannobio), *Fedul and His Children*
(*Fedul s det'mi*, libretto by Catherine II, 1791 Saint Petersburg) –
together with Vicente Martín y Soler|Martin y Soler), *The Pasha of
Tunis* (*Pasha tunisskiy*, 1782 libretto by Mikhail Matinsky) and *You
Shall Be Judged As You Lived* (*Kak pozhivyosh', tak i proslyvyosh*

19th century
------------

The 19th century was the golden age of Russian opera. It began with a
success of a massive and slowly developing operatic project: the opera
*Lesta, dneprovskaya rusalka* and its three sequels (1803–1807, first in
Saint Petersburg) based on the German romantic-comic piece *Das
Donauweibchen* by **Ferdinand Kauer** (1751–1831) with the Russian text
and additional music by Russianized Venetian immigrant **Catterino
Cavos** (1775–1840) and **Stepan Davydov** (1777–1825).

The next success was a patriotic opera *Ivan Susanin* (1815) by Cavos
based on an episode from Russian history.

This success was continued with the brilliant operatic career of
**Alexey Verstovsky** (1799–1862), who composed more 30
opera-vaudevilles and 6 grand-operas including ***Askold's Grave***
(*Askoldova mogila*, first performed in 1835) that received about 200
performances in Saint Petersburg and 400 in Moscow only for the first 25
years.

However the most important events in the history of Russian opera were
two great operas by **Mikhail Glinka** (1804–1857) ***A Life for the
Tsar***, (*Zhizn za tzarya*, originally entitled *Ivan Susanin* 1836)
and ***Ruslan and Lyudmila*** (based on the tale by Alexander Pushkin,
1842. These two works inaugurated a new era in Russian music and upraise
or Russian national opera.

Since these, opera became a leading genre for the most of Russian
composers. Glinka was followed by **Alexander Dargomyzhsky** (1813–1869)
with his ***Rusalka*** (1856) and revolutionary ***The Stone Guest***
(*Kamenny gost*, completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and premiered in 1872).

Other composers were:

-   **Semen Hulak-Artemovsky** (1813–1873) with his 3 operas including
    ***Zaporozhets za Dunayem*** (1863);
-   **Alexander Serov** (1820–1871) with his ***Judith*** (1863)
    ***Rogneda*** (1865) ***The Power of the Fiend*** (*Vrazhya sila*,
    1871);
-   **Anton Rubinstein** (1829–1894) with his 19 operas including ***The
    Demon*** (1875 Saint Petersburg);
-   **César Cui** (1835–1918), with his 14 operas including ***William
    Ratcliff*** (1861–1868);
-   **Eduard Nápravník** (1839–1916), with his 4 operas including
    ***Dubrovsky*** (1895);
-   **Sergei Taneyev** (1856–1915), with ***Oresteia***, (1895, Saint
    Petersburg);
-   **Anton Arensky** (1861–1906), with his 3 operas including *A Dream
    on the Volga* (1880).

Russian opera reached its apogee with the works by Modest Mussorgsky and
his antipode Pyotr Tchaikovsky.

Tschaikowski.jpg|Pyotr Tchaikovsky Image:Aleksandr Borodin.jpg|Aleksandr
Borodin Image:NARK.jpg|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov

**Modest Mussorgsky's** (1839–1881) ***Boris Godunov*** remains the
greatest masterpiece of Russian opera, despite what many consider to be
serious technical faults and a bewildering array of versions (Original
Version of 1869, Revised Version of 1872, Rimsky-Korsakov Edition of
1908, Shostakovich Edition of 1940, etc.). His other operas were left
unfinished:

:\****Salammbô (Mussorgsky)|Salammbô*** (1866)

:\****Zhenit'ba*** (*The Marriage*, 1868)

:\****Khovanshchina*** (1872–1880)

:\****The Fair at Sorochyntsi*** (1874–1880)

**Pyotr Tchaikovsky** (1840–1893) completed ten operas including the
most famous ***Eugene Onegin*** (*Yevgeny Onegin*), 1877–1878, 1879
Moscow and ***The Queen of Spades*** (*Pikovaya dama*), 1890, 1890 Saint
Petersburg, which now belong to the world's standard repertoire. His
other operas are:

:\****Voyevoda*** (*The Voivode*), 1867–1868, destroyed by the composer,
but posthumously reconstructed

:\****Undina*** (or *Undine*), 1869, not completed, partly destroyed by
the composer

:\****The Oprichnik***, 1870–1872, 1874 Saint Petersburg

1885–1887, 1887 Saint Petersburg

:\****Iolanta*** (*Iolanthe*), 1891, 1892 Saint Petersburg

Not less important was **Aleksandr Borodin**’s (1833–1887) ***Prince
Igor*** – (*Knyaz Igor*, completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander
Glazunov, 1890).

Prolific **Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov** (1844–1908) completed fifteen
operas, the most significant achievements of the art of opera in Russia
at the end of the century. The most notable of them are:

:\****May Night*** (*Majskaja noch*) 1878–1879

:\****The Snow Maiden*** (*Snegurochka* 1881 1st version, premiered
1882, Saint Petersburg; c. 1895 2nd version)

:\****Sadko*** (1896, premiered 1898, Moscow)

:\****The Tsar's Bride*** (*Tsarskaya nevesta*1898, premiered 1899,
Moscow)

:\****The Tale of Tsar Saltan*** (*Skazka o tsare Saltane*, premiered
1900, Moscow)

:\****Kashchey the Immortal*** (*Kashchey bessmertny*, 1902)

:\****The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden
Fevroniya*** (*Skazanie o nevidimom grade Kitezhe i deve Fevronii*,
1904)

:\****The Golden Cockerel*** (*Zolotoy petushok*, 1907)

The last three of them already belong to the 20th century Russian opera.

There were built a lot of new opera theatres including Bolshoi Theatre
(opened since 1825 Moscow), and Mariinsky Theatre, opened since 1860
Saint Petersburg).

Mamontov's Private Russian Opera established in 1885. Savva Mamontov
discovered talent of Chaliapin, commissioned designs from Mikhail
Vrubel, Konstantin Korovin, Natalia Goncharova and Ivan Bilibin, staged
the late operas by Rimsky Korsakov.

Opera spread to the provincial centres of Kiev (1867), Odessa (1887) and
Kharkiv (1880).

20th century
------------

The political collisions of 20th century divided Russian opera composers
into those who managed to escape to the West, successfully or not, and
those who continued to live in not particular friendly atmosphere of the
Soviet and Post-Soviet regimes. And nevertheless, the process of
producing of new operas was not diminished, but just opposite, it was
immensely grown.

Zimin Opera established in 1904, Sergei Diaghilev's Saisons Russes began
in Paris in 1913.

**Vladimir Rebikov** (1866–1920) composer of more than 10 operas is best
of all known for his opera *The Christmas Tree* (*Yolka*, 1894–1902) in
which he presented his ideas of “melo-mimics” and “rhythm-declamation”
(see melodeclamation).

**Sergei Rachmaninov** (1873–1943) completed three operas:

:\****Aleko*** (1892, staged 1893)

:\****The Miserly Knight*** (Skupoy Rytsar Op. 24, 1904)

:\****Franchesca da Rimini*** (Op. 25, 1904, staged 1906). All three
operas were staged at the Bolshoi Theatre He began and never finished
the fourth ***Monna Vanna*** (1907, 1st act in a vocal score) after
Maurice Maeterlinck who refused to give permission to the composer for
using of his text. These operas, written on the border between two
centuries, rather belong to the world of the romantic opera of the past.
Escaping Russia in 1917 Rachmaninov had never returned to the operatic
projects again.

Unlike him, **Igor Stravinsky** (1882–1971) had been returning to this
genre again and again, full of fresh and innovative ideas. Sometimes it
is difficult to qualify these works as pure operas but rather
"opera-ballets", "opera-cantatas", or "music theatre". Here is the list:

:\****Le rossignol*** *(The Nightingale)* (1914)

**Dmitri Shostakovich** (1906–1975) was another great opera composer
struggling all his life in the clutch of the communist ideology. His
satirical opera ***The Nose***, after the completely absurd story by
Gogol was criticized in 1929 by RAPM as "formalist". His second opera
***Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District*** performed in 1934 with an
enormous success was condemned by the authorities even more harshly.
This forced him to recompose it much later, in 1962, as *Katerina
Izmailova* in a style more simplified and conventional to meet the
requirements of the new rulers of the regime. Shostakovich was involved
in many more operatic projects.

There were a lot more of the composers about the same generation, who
had managed to create hundreds of operas. Some of them shared the same
problems with Shostakovich and Prokofiev who returned to live to the
Soviet Russia, and was deadly embraced by its suffocative regime. Others
were at the opposite side, serving the suffocating roles. A serious
condemnation and persecution of the Soviet Union's foremost composers,
such as Prokofiev, Shostakovich and many others, had emerged in 1948 in
connection to the opera by **Vano Muradeli** (1908–1970), *Velikaya
druzhba* (***The Great Friendship***); see Zhdanov Doctrine.

Here is just a short list of the opera composers of that times:

:   **Yuri Shaporin** (1887–1966), opera ***The Decembrists*** (written
    during a period of 33 years 1930–1953, staged 1953)
:   **Isaak Dunayevsky** (1900–1955), 14 operettas including *White
    Acacia* (1955)
:   **Alexander Mossolov** (1900–1973), 4 operas including. *The
    Barrage* (1929–1930)
:   **Vissarion Shebalin** (1902–1936), 3 operas including *The Taming
    of the Shrew* (1957)
:   **Dmitri Kabalevsky** (1904–1987), 7 operas including *Colas
    Breugnon* (1936–1976)
:   **Veniamin Fleishman** (1913–1941), opera ***Rothschild's Violin***
    (1941) completed and orchestrated by Dmitri Shostakovich
:   **Tikhon Khrennikov** (1913–2007), 5 operas including "Into the
    Storm" (1936–1939)
:   **Grigory Frid** (1915–2012), 2 chamber mono-operas including *The
    Diary of Anne Frank* (1968)
:   **Mieczysław Weinberg** (1919–1996), 7 operas including *The
    Portrait* (1980) and *The Idiot* (1985)

Also: **Vladimir Shcherbachev, Sergei Vasilenko, Vladimir Fere, Vladimir
Vlasov, Kirill Molchanov, Alexander Kholminov**, etc. (see: Russian
opera articles\#20th century).

The next generations who found themselves already in the Post-Stalin
epoch had own specific problems. The ideological and stylistic control
and limitation of creative freedom by the authorities and older
colleagues-composers in the hierarchical structures of the Union of
Composers made almost impossible the innovation and experiment in any
field of musical art. It was a feeling that old bad times returned
again, when in 1979 at the Sixth Congress of the Composers' Union, its
leader Tikhon Khrennikov denounced seven composers (thereafter known as
the "Khrennikov Seven"), who for some reason or other had been played in
the West – there were at least four opera composers among them.

As a result even quite new phenomena appeared: a "samizdat (underground)
opera" (see Nikolai Karetnikov). Some of these operas still never been
performed, others luckily received their premieres in the West, and only
a few found their place at the operatic stages of the homeland. The
collapse of the Soviet Union did not improve this hopeless situation
much.

The list of the composers who contributed to the development of Russian
opera nearer to the end of the 20th century:

:   **Edison Denisov** (1929–1996), 3 Operas including *L'écume des
    jours (opera)|L'écume des jours* ( *The Foam of Days*, completed
    1981)
:   **Nikolai Karetnikov** (1930–1994), 2 operas including *Till
    Eulenspiegel*, opera in two acts (1965–1985)
:   **Sergei Slonimsky** (born 1932), 3 operas including *Mary Stewart*
    (1978–1980)
:   **Rodion Shchedrin** (born 1932), 3 operas including *Myortvye
    dushi* (*Dead Souls* 1976)
:   **Alfred Schnittke** (1934–1998), 3 operas including *Zhizn’ s
    idiotom* (*Life with an Idiot*, 1990–1991)

    solntse* (*The Stolen Sun*, 1968)
:   **Alexander Knaifel** (born 1943) 2 operas including *Kentervilskoye
    prividenie* (***The Canterville Ghost***, 1965–1966)

    Rainer)*** (1989)

    Nightingale and the Rose***

Hrabovsky, Alexander Vustin, Gleb Sedelnikov, Merab Gagnidze, Alexander
Tchaikovsky, Vasily Lobanov, Dmitri N. Smirnov, Leonid Bobylev, Vladimir
Tarnopolsky**, and so on (see: Russian opera articles\#20th century).

21st century
------------

The Russian opera is continuing its development in the 21st century. It
began with the noisy premieres of two comic operas, whose genre could be
explained as "opera-farce":

The first was *Tsar Demyan* – *a frightful opera performance* (a
collective project of the five participants: composers **Leonid
Desyatnikov** and **Vyacheslav Gaivoronsky** from Saint Petersburg,
**Iraida Yusupova** and **Vladimir Nikolayev** from Moscow, and the
creative collective "Kompozitor," (a pseudonym for the well-known music
critic Pyotr Pospelov) to the libretto by Elena Polenova after a
folk-drama *Tsar Maksimilyan*, premiere June 20, 2001 Mariinski Theatre,
Saint Petersburg. Prize "Gold Mask, 2002" and "Gold Soffit, 2002".

Another opera ***Rosenthal's Children*** by Leonid Desyatnikov to the
libretto by Vladimir Sorokin, was commissioned by the Bolshoi Theatre
and premiered on March 23, 2005. The staging of the opera was
accompanied by juicy scandal, however made an enormous success.
