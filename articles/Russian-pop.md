**Russian pop music** is Russian-language pop music produced either in
Russia or other countries. This is the successor to popular "variety"
Soviet music with its pop idols such as Alla Pugachova or Valery
Leontiev.

Modern-day mainstream Russian-language pop music is extremely diverse
and has many ways to spread through the audience. The most famous pop
stars can be seen on general television in music or talk shows, and also
on music TV channels such as MTV Russia and Muz-TV. There are also
Russian Pop radio stations, and there's been lots of one-hit-wonders in
recent years.
