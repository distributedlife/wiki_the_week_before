The **municipal divisions in Russia** are called the **municipal
formations** .

In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004–2005, all federal
subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of the local
self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The
reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified
structure of the municipal government bodies by January 1, 2005, and a
law enforcing the reform provisions went into effect on January 1, 2006.
According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called
municipal formations) are as follows:

-   Municipal district (or municipal raion), a group of urban and rural
    settlements, often along with the inter-settlement territories. In
    practice, municipal districts are usually formed within the
    boundaries of existing administrative districts.
    -   Urban settlement, a city/town or an urban-type settlement,
        possibly together with adjacent rural and/or urban localities
    -   Rural settlement, one or several rural localities
-   Urban okrug, an urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal
    district. In practice, urban okrugs are usually formed within the
    boundaries of existing cities of federal subject significance.
-   Intra-city territory of a federal city, a part of a federal city's
    territory. In Moscow, these are called municipal formations (which
    correspond to administrative districts); in St. Petersburg they are
    known as municipal okrugs, municipal towns, and municipal
    settlements.

Territories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as
inter-settlement territories.
